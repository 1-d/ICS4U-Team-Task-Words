Words

In your project teams, create a Greenfoot program that uses data structures learned in class.  You will read a file containing hundreds of words from a file into one or more data structures.

You should use at least 3 different data structures as described here:

1.  Stack or Queue (Using your own implementation created in class)

2.  ArrayList (Using Java-provided implementation)

3.  HashMap or HashSet (Using Java-provided implementation)

Decide what you want to do with those words in your program.  Keep your concept simple and attainable.  Some ideas might be:

- Word collage + features

- Scrolling text + features

- Simple word game (emphasis on simple)

You must have the program complete by due date.  Plan and manage your group so that you are working without rushing to meet the deadline.
